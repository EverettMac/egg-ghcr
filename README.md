This is Embotic's fork of Pelican Panel's yolks repo with a little addition. For the main eggs (Java, Python, NodeJS) we've added something to prevent storage filling. For some reason users like to fill up our and plenty other hosts storage by running a storage flooder. We added something to prevent that via the Dockerfile.

## Contriubting
This is completely open source so you can take it if you'd like. If you found something like a bug or suggestion, just create a fork of the repo and request a new pull request once you've edited thr files.
